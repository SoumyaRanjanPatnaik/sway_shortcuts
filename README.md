# Build

To build the project, first make sure you have CMake >= v3.5 and have `qt6-base` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoumyaRanjanPatnaik/sway_shortcuts.git
cd sway_shortcuts
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make
```

You can then execute the compiled binary

```
./sway_shortcuts
```

# Installation

`cd` into project root and use the following commands to install.

```bash
cd build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make install
```

The following files are created.

```
/usr/local/bin/sway_shortcuts
/etc/sway_shortcuts/default.json
```

# Usage

On opening `sway_shortcuts` for the first time, the default configs will be loaded and `~/.config/swaykbd-settings/config.json` will be created, which stores the user configurations. The ui will show a combo box with an option to select a action and view/modify its corresponding shortcuts. On applying the settings or saving, a new file `~/.config/swaykbd-settings/kbd_config` will be created which contains the generated configurations for sway (or i3).

You can click on the combo box to select the currently selected action and the keybindings for are displayed in the Shortcut field. To modify the keybinding, click on the edit button and enter the keybinding you want. To restore default keybindings, click on the `Reset Defaults` button. If the shortcut needs to be available even from lock screen, mark `Available in lock screen` as checked.

In order to add a new action or edit and action click on `Add Action` and `Edit Action`. This will open a Add/Edit Action window.
